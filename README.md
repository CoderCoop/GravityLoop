# 🌌 GravityLoop

**Spaceship golf across the curves of spacetime.**

Gravity is rendered as 3D terrain: every planet bends the neon grid into a
well, repulsors bulge it into hills, and black holes tear it into bottomless
funnels. Your ship's height on the terrain *is* its potential energy — dive
into a well and you speed up, climb out and you slow down.

Slingshot-launch your ship (drag back and release, golf style), watch the live
trajectory prediction bend through the gravity field, and reach the golden
ring. Fewer launches = more stars.

## Play

**Online:** once this repo's Pages deployment is live, play at
<https://codercoop.github.io/GravityLoop/> (deployed automatically from
`main` by `.github/workflows/pages.yml`).

**Locally:** the game is a static page but uses ES modules, so it needs any
local web server:

```bash
cd GravityLoop
python3 -m http.server 8000
# or: npx serve
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000>.

## Controls

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Drag + release | Aim and launch (drag farther = more power) |
| WASD / arrow keys | Tiny mid-flight thrusts — limited fuel ⛽ |
| R | Restart level |
| N | Next level (after winning) |
| M | Mute |
| Esc | Cancel aim |

## Levels

Eight levels of gradually increasing difficulty: a straight tutorial shot, a
first bending well, a forced slingshot, a binary-star saddle, a repulsor
ridge, an orbiting moon that demands release timing, a black hole skim, and a
grand finale with everything at once.

Level difficulty is tuned with a headless solver that brute-forces launch
angle/power/timing through the real physics:

```bash
node tools/solve.js        # verify all levels are winnable + difficulty stats
node tools/solve.js 4      # check a single level (0-indexed)
```

## Tech

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org) (vendored in `vendor/`) for rendering — a
  single indexed `LineSegments` grid displaced by the gravitational potential.
- `src/physics.js` — pure, dependency-free physics core (softened
  inverse-square gravity, semi-implicit Euler, trajectory prediction), shared
  between the browser game and the Node solver.
- `src/levels.js` — level data.
- `src/audio.js` — tiny WebAudio synth, no sound assets.
- No build step.
